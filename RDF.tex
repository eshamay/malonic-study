% show rdfs of the ab initio & classical runs for malonic

% talk about similarities and differences

% suggest the deficiency in the classical, and how a better model should be developed to capture that first peak on the alcohol.

The acid alcohol moiety oxygen - water hydrogen RDF (left) and the carbonyl oxygen - water hydrogen RDF (right) are plotted. Each RDF is shown for both the ab initio simulations of the present study (black), and for classical MD simulations (green) taken from a data set used for a recently published study by our group.\cite{Blower2012}}
