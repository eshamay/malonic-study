  abstract = {Relative energies and vibrational spectra of the conformational states
	of a malonic acid monomer (HOOCCH2COOH) were calculated using various
	levels of approximation [Hartree-Fock (HF), Moller-Plesset to second
	order (MP2), and B3LYP density functional theory (DFT)I. The calculations
	predict the existence of six different conformers according to skeletal
	C-C bond and O-H bond rotation. Three conformers are found with energies
	close enough to enable their spectroscopic observation. The lowest-energy
	conformer (I) shows a nearly planar structure with an OH . . .O=C
	intramolecular hydrogen bond closing a six-member O=C-CH2-C-O-H ring.
	The second- and third-lower energy conformers (LI and III) differ
	from the conformational ground state by less than 5 kJ mol(-1). Conformers
	II and III adopt a cis arrangement around the C-O bonds: conformer
	II exhibits the two carbonyl bonds in a nearly orthogonal arrangement,
	with one carboxylic group in the plane containing the carbon atoms,
	whereas in conformer III (C-2 symmetry), the carbonyl bonds make
	a dihedral angle of ca. 120 degrees, and both carboxylic groups are
	placed out of the plane containing the skeletal carbons. Their relative
	energy is predicted by the highest-level calculations to be ca. 1
	kJ mol(-1). The theoretical predictions agree with the analysis of
	the infrared spectra of monomeric malonic acid isolated in a solid
	argon matrix, where the presence of the three above-mentioned conformers
	was unequivocally identified. Narrowband tunable irradiation in the
	near-infrared region was found to promote efficiently the interconversion
	between the experimentally observed conformers.},

	isolated in an argon matrix at 7.5 K was studied by infrared spectroscopy.
	For the first time, three conformational states of this molecule
	were identified experimentally and their vibrational spectra are
	assigned. In good agreement with density functional theory predictions,
	all the observed conformers exhibit a trans O=C-C=O axis, differing
	in the relative conformation of their O-C-O-H axes. In the most stable
	conformer (belonging to the C-2h symmetry point group), two intramolecular
	OH ... O= hydrogen bonds are present, The second (C-s) most stable
	conformer shows a single OH ... O= bond, and the third one (C-2h)
	does not exhibit any intramolecular hydrogen bond. Using narrowband
	tunable irradiation in the near-infrared region it was possible to
	promote very efficiently conformer interconversions, which was followed

  abstract = {The various conformers of the dicarboxylic acids HO(2)C-(CH(2))(n)-CO(2)H,
	n = 1-4, were obtained using density functional methods (DFT), both
	in the gas phase and in the aqueous phase using a polarized continuum
	model (PCM). Several new conformers were identified, particularly
	for the two larger molecules glutaric (n = 3) and adipic acid (n
	=4). The PCM results show that the stability of most conformers were
	affected, many becoming unstable in the aqueous phase; and the energy
	ordering of conformers is also different. The results suggest that
	conformational preferences could be important in determining the
	design and stability of appropriate synthetic receptors for glutaric
	and adipic acid. Geometry changes between gas and aqueous phases
	were most marked in those conformers containing an intramolecular
	hydrogen bond. Additional calculations have probed the strength of
	intramolecular hydrogen bonds in these dicarboxylic acids. In the
	cases of glutaric and adipic acid, the strength of the intramolecular
	hydrogen bond were estimated to be around 28-29 kJ/mol, without any
	vibrational energy correction. The intramolecular hydrogen bond energies
	in malonic and succinic acid were also estimated from the calculated
	H-bond distances using an empirical relationship. Intramolecular
	H-bond redshifts of 170-250 cm(-1) have been estimated from the results
	of the harmonic frequency analyses. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
