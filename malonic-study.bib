	its analytic form. It is separable and has optimal decay properties
	in both real and Fourier space. Because of this property, the application
	of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotential to a wave function can
	be done efficiently on a grid in real space. Real space integration
	is much faster for large systems than ordinary multiplication in
	Fourier space, since it shows only quadratic scaling with respect
	to the size of the system. We systematically verify the high accuracy
	of these pseudopotentials by extensive atomic and molecular test

	levels of approximation [Hartree-Fock (HF), Moller-Plesset to second
	order (MP2), and B3LYP density functional theory (DFT)I. The calculations
	predict the existence of six different conformers according to skeletal
	C-C bond and O-H bond rotation. Three conformers are found with energies
	close enough to enable their spectroscopic observation. The lowest-energy
	conformer (I) shows a nearly planar structure with an OH . . .O=C
	intramolecular hydrogen bond closing a six-member O=C-CH2-C-O-H ring.
	The second- and third-lower energy conformers (LI and III) differ
	from the conformational ground state by less than 5 kJ mol(-1). Conformers
	II and III adopt a cis arrangement around the C-O bonds: conformer
	II exhibits the two carbonyl bonds in a nearly orthogonal arrangement,
	with one carboxylic group in the plane containing the carbon atoms,
	whereas in conformer III (C-2 symmetry), the carbonyl bonds make
	a dihedral angle of ca. 120 degrees, and both carboxylic groups are
	placed out of the plane containing the skeletal carbons. Their relative
	energy is predicted by the highest-level calculations to be ca. 1
	kJ mol(-1). The theoretical predictions agree with the analysis of
	the infrared spectra of monomeric malonic acid isolated in a solid
	argon matrix, where the presence of the three above-mentioned conformers
	was unequivocally identified. Narrowband tunable irradiation in the
	near-infrared region was found to promote efficiently the interconversion

  abstract = {The various conformers of the dicarboxylic acids HO(2)C-(CH(2))(n)-CO(2)H,
	n = 1-4, were obtained using density functional methods (DFT), both
	in the gas phase and in the aqueous phase using a polarized continuum
	model (PCM). Several new conformers were identified, particularly
	for the two larger molecules glutaric (n = 3) and adipic acid (n
	=4). The PCM results show that the stability of most conformers were
	affected, many becoming unstable in the aqueous phase; and the energy
	ordering of conformers is also different. The results suggest that
	conformational preferences could be important in determining the
	design and stability of appropriate synthetic receptors for glutaric
	and adipic acid. Geometry changes between gas and aqueous phases
	were most marked in those conformers containing an intramolecular
	hydrogen bond. Additional calculations have probed the strength of
	intramolecular hydrogen bonds in these dicarboxylic acids. In the
	cases of glutaric and adipic acid, the strength of the intramolecular
	hydrogen bond were estimated to be around 28-29 kJ/mol, without any
	vibrational energy correction. The intramolecular hydrogen bond energies
	in malonic and succinic acid were also estimated from the calculated
	H-bond distances using an empirical relationship. Intramolecular
	H-bond redshifts of 170-250 cm(-1) have been estimated from the results
	of the harmonic frequency analyses. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	nitric acid is present on the surface of a nitric acid solution.
	Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we show that a nitric
	acid molecule present on an aqueous solution surface structures and
	orients in a way that significantly reduces its ability to be the
	strong dissociating acid that it is in aqueous solution. Hydrogen
	bonding to surface solvating water molecules plays a key role in

	in QUICKSTEP which is part of the freely available program package
	CP2K. The GPW method allows for accurate density functional calculations
	in gas and condensed phases and can be effectively used for molecular
	dynamics simulations. We show how derivatives of the GPW energy functional,
	namely ionic forces and the Kohn-Sham matrix, can be computed in
	a consistent way. The computational cost of computing the total energy
	and the Kohn-Sham matrix is scaling linearly with the system size,
	even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens of atoms. The
	efficiency of the method allows for the use of large Gaussian basis
	sets for systems up to 3000 atoms, and we illustrate the accuracy
	of the method for various basis sets in gas and condensed phases.
	Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules and
	plane wave based calculations in the condensed phase is excellent.
	Wave function optimisation with the orbital transformation technique
	leads to good parallel performance, and outperforms traditional diagonalisation
	methods. Energy conserving Born-Oppenheimer dynamics can be performed,
	and a highly efficient scheme is obtained using an extrapolation
	of the density matrix. We illustrate these findings with calculations
	using commodity PCs as well as supercomputers. (c) 2005 Elsevier
