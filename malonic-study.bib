  abstract = {Aliphatic straight-chain dicarboxylic acids have been identified as
	common water-soluble organic components of atmospheric aerosols.
	To model the partitioning of such compounds between gas and particle
	phase in the atmosphere, information about their vapor pressures
	is essential. In this work, vapor pressures of C3-C9 dicarboxylic
	acids are derived from measured evaporation rates of submicron aerosols
	over the temperature range of 290314 K using the tandem differential
	mobility analyzer technique. Vapor pressures obtained from the experimental
	data were as follows: log(P-malonic(o), Pa)= -4822 K/T + 12.9, log(P-succinic(o),
	Pa) = -7196.8 K/T + 19.8, P-glutaric(o) (296 K) = 6.7 x 10(-4) Pa,
	log(P-adipic(o), Pa) = -8065.0 Kg/T + 22.2, log(P-pimelic(o), Pa)
	= -7692.8 K/T + 21.8, 109(P-suberic(o), Pa) = P -9629.4 K/T + 26.5,
	and log(P-azelaic(o), Pa) = -7968.7 K/T + 21.7. Vapor pressures of
	C3-C9 dicarboxylic acids are shown to alternate strongly with the
	parity of the number of carbon atoms. Higher vapor pressures of the
	odd acids fit the less stable crystal structure, the propensity of
	polymorphism in the odd acids, and the evolution of melting temperatures.
	Results are compared with available literature data.},

	simulations performed at tropospheric temperatures. Although the
	oxalic acid-water interaction is strong at low coverage, due to the
	possible formation of a large number of hydrogen bonds between the
	adsorbed oxalic acid and the surface water molecules, the results
	of the simulations at finite coverage show the predominant role played
	by the oxalic acid-oxalic acid lateral interactions in the adsorption/desorption
	process. These interactions are even stronger than the water-water
	or water-oxalic acid interactions. With increasing temperature these
	strong lateral interactions favor the formation of oxalic acid aggregates
	on the ice surface, with the concomitant departure of water molecules
	through the ducts in the adsorbed layer created by the aggregation
	process. These results support conclusions of experimental data on
	the oxalic acid-ice interactions. Moreover, in comparison to previously
	obtained results for formic and acetic acid adsorbed on ice, the
	present study suggests that not only the organic functionality is
	of importance for atmospheric implications of partially oxidized

	(61.5 ng m(-3)), which comprised approximately 70% of the total diacids

	succinic acid (C-4) is likely produced by photooxidation of 4-oxocarboxylic
	acids, which are present in the atmosphere as intermediates of the
	photooxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. These results indicate
	that the Antarctic organic aerosols originate from marine-derived
	lipids and are transformed largely by photochemical oxidations. omega-Oxocarboxylic
	acids (C-2-C-9, 0.36-3.0 ng m(-3)) also showed the highest concentration

	n = 1-4, were obtained using density functional methods (DFT), both
	in the gas phase and in the aqueous phase using a polarized continuum
	model (PCM). Several new conformers were identified, particularly
	for the two larger molecules glutaric (n = 3) and adipic acid (n
	=4). The PCM results show that the stability of most conformers were
	affected, many becoming unstable in the aqueous phase; and the energy
	ordering of conformers is also different. The results suggest that
	conformational preferences could be important in determining the
	design and stability of appropriate synthetic receptors for glutaric

	were most marked in those conformers containing an intramolecular

	hydrogen bond were estimated to be around 28-29 kJ/mol, without any

	tendency to curl up into a helical structure, forming either a tgggt
	or a tg'g'g't conformation. The carboxylic head groups are strongly
	hydrated in the water solution, while the hydrophobic hydrocarbon
	skeleton is surrounded by water molecules in a packed structure.
	In the helical conformation, the surface area of the nonpolar part
	of the fatty acid is minimized against water phase. Transitions between

	mono-anionic forms of suberic acid in water solution. Suberic acid
	dissolved in methanol does not show any conformational preferences.
	Along the hydrocarbon chain, g, g', and t conformers are equally
	populated. The head group torsional angles, however, strongly prefer
	trans conformation due to dipolar interactions between the carboxyl
	groups and the solvent hydroxyl groups. In addition to MD simulations,

  abstract = {Ambient particulate matter contains polar multifunctional oxygenates
	that partition between the vapor and aerosol phases. Vapor pressure
	predictions are required to determine the gas-particle partitioning
	of such organic compounds. We present here a method based on atomistic
	simulations combined with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to predict
	the liquid vapor pressure, enthalpies of vaporization, and heats
	of sublimation of atmospheric organic compounds. The resulting temperature-dependent
	vapor pressure equation is a function of the heat of vaporization
	at the normal boiling point [DeltaH(vap)(T-b)], normal boiling point
	(T-b), and the change in heat capacity (liquid to gas) of the compound
	upon phase change [DeltaC(p)(T-b)]. We show that heats of vaporization
	can be estimated from calculated cohesive energy densities (CED)
	of the pure compound obtained from multiple sampling molecular dynamics.
	The simulation method (CED) uses a generic force field (Dreiding)
	and molecular models with atomic charges determined from quantum
	mechanics. The heats of vaporization of five dicarboxylic acids [malonic
	(C-3) succinic (C-4), glutaric (C-5), adipic (C-6), and pimelic (C-7)]
	are calculated at 500 K. Results are in agreement with experimental
	values with an averaged error of about 4%. The corresponding heats
	of sublimation at 298 K are also predicted using molecular simulations.
	Vapor pressures of the five dicarboxylic acids are also predicted
	using the derived Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Predicted liquid vapor
	pressures agree well with available literature data with an averaged
	error of 29%, while the predicted solid vapor pressures at ambient
	temperature differ considerably from a recent study by Bilde et al.
	(Environ. Sci. Technol. 2003, 37, 1371-1378) (an average of 70%).
	The difference is attributed to the linear dependence assumption
	that we used in the derived Clausius-Clapeyron equation.},

	in gas and condensed phases and can be effectively used for molecular
	dynamics simulations. We show how derivatives of the GPW energy functional,
	namely ionic forces and the Kohn-Sham matrix, can be computed in
	a consistent way. The computational cost of computing the total energy
	and the Kohn-Sham matrix is scaling linearly with the system size,
	even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens of atoms. The
	efficiency of the method allows for the use of large Gaussian basis
	sets for systems up to 3000 atoms, and we illustrate the accuracy
	of the method for various basis sets in gas and condensed phases.
	Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules and
	plane wave based calculations in the condensed phase is excellent.
	Wave function optimisation with the orbital transformation technique
	leads to good parallel performance, and outperforms traditional diagonalisation
	methods. Energy conserving Born-Oppenheimer dynamics can be performed,
	and a highly efficient scheme is obtained using an extrapolation
	of the density matrix. We illustrate these findings with calculations

	Cu surface have been investigated by reflect ion-absorption infrared
	spectroscopy (RAIRS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)
	methods. The desorption of H2O and C2H2O4 was studied; we found that
	the ice desorption temperature increases with the ice-film thickness.
	Desorption of the C2H2O4 layer involves a structural modification
	and sublimation. The H2O/C2H2O4 and C2H2O4/H2O interfaces and the
	codeposited C2H2O4+H2O were prepared on the Cu surface by varying
	deposition sequences of gaseous C2H2O4 and H2O at 155 K. We found
	that the interaction between ice and C2H2O4 does not lead to the
	H2O-induced deprotonation of C2H2O4 in a temperature range 155-283
	K. However, H-bonding interactions between H2O and C2H2O4 can lead
	to the formation of a metastable oxalic acid-ice complex in the C2H2O4/H2O
	and C2H2O4+H2O systems during the TPD process. Desorption of H2O
	from the C2H2O4/H2O/Cu system is suggested to involve the diffusion
	of H2O through the top C2H2O4 layer. H2O desorption is followed by
	a rearrangement of C2H2O4 to form a C2H2O4 adlayer on Cu in the C2H2O4+H2O
	system. These experimental findings suggest that C(2)HlO(4) is not
	ionized oil snow and ice in the polar boundary layer and at upper
	tropospheric temperatures (similar to 240 K).},

	phthalic and fumaric) have been measured with a differential scanning
	calorimeter. The results show that only the dihydrate of oxalic acid
	(OAD) acts as a heterogeneous ice nucleus, with an increase in freezing
	temperature between 2 and 5K depending on solution composition. In
	several field campaigns, oxalic acid enriched particles have been
	detected in the upper troposphere with single particle aerosol mass
	spectrometry. Simulations with a microphysical box model indicate
	that the presence of OAD may reduce the ice particle number density
	in cirrus clouds by up to similar to 50% when compared to exclusively
	homogeneous cirrus formation without OAD. Using the ECHAM4 climate
	model we estimate the global net radiative effect caused by this
	heterogeneous freezing to result in a cooling as high as -0.3 Wm(-2).},
